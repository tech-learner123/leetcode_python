Two steps: 1. find the value 2. remove the value, 3. update the tree (option)
[1,2,3,4,]
if the removed point is the leaf node, no step 3
if the removed point is in the middle, need to update the tree
have two ways,
1. if the node has right node, fill the node with the right node successor
2. if the node has only left node, fill the node with the predecessor, going all the way to the right
